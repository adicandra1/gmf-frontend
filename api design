so this how the api security design looks like:


Resources: 	vacancy list & detail => (admin, hrd, user)
						(detail => (admin, hrd, user)
						applied, => (admin, hrd, user)
						accepted, => (admin, hrd, user [could be edited])
						, 
						user list => admin, hrd
						(education, experience, skills, resume),

App level API key: basic app resource = like vacancy and it's details

user api key: personal info resource = like, experience password name username email

hrd api key : hrd specific resource = like, recuitment
